    "When deliver an argument to a function in Python, what is technically set is a reference to the object pointed to by the argument. In other words, the name of the argument is used within the function to access the object referenced by the argument. Also, assigning a value to a variable is assigning a reference to an object to the variable. Therefore, assigning a value to a number also follows a rule of \"Call by Assignment\". Therefore, when calling a function argument, the value can change depending on whether the argument is a mutable object or immutable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it is mentioned on the above, since a container that can be written is mutable, it could be understood as a shallow copy. In python, immutable data types(tuples, numbers, strings) can be regarded as a deep compy where the value is directly changed. On the other hand, mutable data types, containers that can be written) appy a shallow copy(only copying the pointer internally). It is shown as a function 'object.copy()'. In order to copy the actual value, a deep copy, it must be used with the function.\n",
